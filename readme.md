# AI utils in C++ (still under development)

## Aim:
I created this library to test AI stuff out using C++ (challenging yet rewarding task), basically because people consider C++ to be not so user-friendly when it comes to AI/ML applications. My target is to cross that boundary and make C++ too a useful tool for AI/ML developers.

## Functionalities Intended (status marked on the right with emojis):
* Dataframe reading / reading data from CSV files ✔️
* Data preprocessing (planned: normalisation, outlier removal, label encoding, train-test splitting) ❌
* Simple AI / the generic stuff (i.e., those that don't require learning)❌
* Simple ML algorithms (planned: Simple Linear/Logistic Regression, Perceptron, kNN (k-Nearest Neighbours), Bayesian classifier)❌
* Simple evaluation of performance❌

## Intended Users
C++-savvy pursuers of AI/ML studies. All contributions are welcome from whosoever is interested in developing this.

NB: I had edited the .hpp and .cpp files assuming that you have downloaded the library in the `include` folder of the C++ compiler (I used `g++`). Do change stuff as needed so as to suit your needs.

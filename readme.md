# AI utils in C++

## Aim:
I created this library to test AI stuff out using C++ (challenging yet rewarding task), basically because people consider C++ to be not so user-friendly when it comes to AI/ML applications. My target is to cross that oundary and make C++ too a useful tool for AI/ML developers.

## Functionalities Intended:
* Dataframe reading / reading data from CSV files
* Data preprocessing (planned: normalisation, outlier removal, label encoding, train-test splitting)
* Simple AI / the generic stuff (i.e., those that don't require learning)
* Simple ML algorithms (planned: Simple Linear/Logistic Regression, Perceptron, kNN (k-Nearest Neighbours), Bayesian classifier)
* Simple evaluation performance

## Intended Users
C++-savvy pursuers of AI/ML studies. All contributions are welcome from whosoever is interested in developing this.
